# Glossary

Terms used across rosary, agents, and ADRs.

## Work hierarchy (BDR lattice)

| Term        | What                                                                                                                          | Example                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Decade**  | One ADR decomposed — the top-level organizing primitive. Contains threads. Named after a rosary decade (10 beads in a group). | `ADR-003` "Linear hierarchy mapping"          |
| **Thread**  | A semantic grouping of related beads within a decade: context, implementation, validation, etc.                               | `ADR-003/implementation`                      |
| **Bead**    | Atomic work item. Lives in a repo's `.beads/` Dolt database. The unit an agent receives, works, and closes.                   | `rsry-d93546` "Add webhook HMAC verification" |
| **Channel** | BDR visibility tier. Decade (internal) → Thread (team) → Bead (external). Maps atoms to the right granularity.                | `BdrChannel::Bead`                            |
| **Atom**    | A single extractable concept from a document — friction point, decision, phase, validation point, etc. Decomposed into beads. | `AtomKind::Phase` "Phase 1: Scaffold"         |

## Orchestrator

| Term           | What                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reconciler** | The core loop: scan → triage → dispatch → verify → report → sleep. Kubernetes-controller-style desired-state reconciliation.                       |
| **Triage**     | Scoring open beads to decide dispatch priority. Composite: 40% priority, 30% dependency readiness, 20% age, 10% retry penalty.                     |
| **Dispatch**   | Spawning an agent in an isolated workspace to work a bead. Assigns the bead to an agent + provider + compute backend.                              |
| **Pipeline**   | The sequence of agent perspectives a bead passes through: dev → staging → prod → feature. Each phase is a different agent with a different lens.   |
| **Generation** | Content hash of a bead (id + title + description + priority). When it changes, the bead is re-triaged. Prevents redundant work on unchanged beads. |
| **Backoff**    | Exponential delay after dispatch failure: `min(30s × 2^retries, 30min)`. After 5 retries, the bead is deadlettered.                                |
| **Deadletter** | A bead that has exhausted retries or hit 3 consecutive regressions. Blocked for human attention — agents won't touch it.                           |

## Execution

| Term                | What                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AgentProvider**   | Which model runs: Claude, Codex, Gemini, ACP. Returns an `AgentSession`.                                                                                  |
| **ComputeProvider** | Where the agent runs: `local` (host subprocess) or `sprites` (remote container via sprites.dev).                                                   |
| **Workspace**       | Isolated VCS environment for an agent to work in. jj workspace (preferred) or git worktree (fallback). Destroyed after verification.               |
| **ACP**             | Agent Client Protocol — a language-neutral JSON-RPC interface for driving an agent with per-tool-call permission callbacks. rosary has a native ACP client (`src/acp.rs`).            |

## Verification

| Term       | What                                                                                      |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tier** | One check in the verification pipeline. Tiers run in order (`src/verify.rs`); first failure short-circuits. The Rust order: commit exists → bead ref (Rule 11) → compile → test → lint → close-condition (if declared) → diff sanity → mache blast-radius + duplication (advisory) → adversarial review. |
| **close-condition tier** | Runs the bead's declared acceptance command/criteria — a fold can't close a bead against a "done" that was never checked. |
| **diff sanity** | Rejects implausibly large diffs. |
| **review tier** | Nonce-fenced adversarial review of the change. |

## Storage

| Term            | What                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dolt**        | Version-controlled SQL database. Each repo has a `.beads/` directory with its own Dolt server. Beads live here.                                                                                             |
| **Backend**     | Rosary's own persistent state store (`~/.rsry/dolt/rosary/`). Stores cross-repo relationships: pipeline state, dispatch history, decades/threads, Linear links. Separate from per-repo bead Dolt databases. |
| **Linear**      | External issue tracker used as a human-facing UI. Bidirectional sync — beads are source of truth, Linear is a projection.                                                                                   |
| **LinearLink**  | Mapping between a bead and its Linear representation (issue, sub-issue, or milestone). Replaces the overloaded `external_ref` field.                                                                        |
| **Mirror bead** | (Legacy) A cross-repo reference created by copying a bead into another repo's `.beads/`. Being replaced by `CrossRepoDep` in the backend.                                                                   |

## Agent perspectives

| Agent             | Lens                        | Scope          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | -------------- |
| **dev-agent**     | Implementation quality      | Function-level |
| **staging-agent** | Test validity (adversarial) | Test files     |
| **prod-agent**    | Production quality          | Module-level   |
| **feature-agent** | Cross-file coherence        | Feature branch |
| **pm-agent**      | Strategic perspective       | Cross-repo     |

## Config & state

| Term                      | What                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`~/.rsry/config.toml`** | Global config: repos, Linear settings, compute, HTTP/tunnel, backend.                 |
| **`rosary.toml`**         | Per-project config (overrides global for that repo).                                  |
| **`rosary-self.toml`**    | Self-management config — rosary watches its own repo (dogfooding).                    |
| **Session registry**      | `~/.rsry/sessions.json` — tracks active agent PIDs. Pruned of dead processes on load. |

## Plugins

| Term                      | What                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Plugin**                | Out-of-process executable that extends rosary along a `kind` axis. Discovered from `~/.rsry/plugins/` and `<repo>/.rosary/plugins/`.                     |
| **`kind = "hook"`**       | Pipeline hook (default). Runs at `pipeline.triage` / `pipeline.verify` / `pipeline.close`.                                                               |
| **`kind = "mcp"`**        | Outbound MCP server — rosary connects to it as a client (planned).                                                                                       |
| **`kind = "dispatch"`**   | Alternative `AgentProvider` (e.g. local model runner, sprites).                                                                                          |
| **`kind = "state_sink"`** | Mirrors bead state to an external system (planned).                                                                                                      |
| **Coverage gate**         | A `pipeline.verify` plugin can return `coverage: 0..1`. When a bead's `doc_coverage_min` is set, rosary fails verify if coverage is below the threshold. |
| **`assay.scan`**          | Scan-time hook. `rsry scan --assay` calls these plugins per repo, files P3 chore beads for each reported stale ref.                                      |

## Provenance & capture

| Term                               | What                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`ProvenanceRef`**                | Tagged enum tracking where a bead's atom came from. Variants: `Doc { path }`, `Session { transcript_path, summary }`, `Code { repo, path, symbol }`, `Meeting`, `SlackThread`. Stored in `Bead.derived_from`. |
| **`rsry capture --from-session`**  | Reads a transcript file, extracts BDR atoms via LLM, produces BeadSpecs with `Session` provenance.                                                                                                            |
| **`rsry capture --from-code`**     | Reads a source file (optionally scoped to a symbol), extracts atoms via LLM, produces BeadSpecs with `Code` provenance.                                                                                       |
| **`rsry decompose --stub-output`** | Emits Rust skeletons (`.rsry-stubs/<decade>.rs`) from `TechnicalSpec` and `Constraint` atoms — review the stub PR before implementing to validate the design.                                                 |
| **Verifiable test command**        | `rsry bead close` requires impl beads (bug/feature/task/chore) to have a recognised test command (`cargo test`, `pytest`, `npm test`, etc.) in their description. Override with `--force`.                    |

## Encrypted notes

| Term                    | What                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**               | Subdirectory of `notes/` (e.g. `notes/work/`, `notes/public/`) holding age-encrypted notes for one access tier.                              |
| **Recipients file**     | `notes/<scope>/.recipients` — newline-separated age recipients allowed to decrypt that scope.                                                |
| **`rsry notes rotate`** | Re-encrypts every `*.age` file in a scope after applying `--add-recipient` / `--remove-recipient` edits. Refuses to rotate to an empty list. |
