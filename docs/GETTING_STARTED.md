# Getting Started

How to go from zero to productive with rosary and the ART toolchain.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Rust toolchain
brew install rustup
rustup-init  # follow prompts, then restart shell

# Version control
brew install jj fuse-t

# ART tools
brew tap agentic-research/tap
brew install mache beads

# Claude Code (the AI pair-programming CLI)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

You need org access to [agentic-research](https://github.com/agentic-research) on GitHub.

## Clone

```bash
mkdir -p ~/remotes/art && cd ~/remotes/art
git clone git@github.com:agentic-research/rosary.git
git clone git@github.com:agentic-research/ley-line.git
git clone git@github.com:agentic-research/mache.git
git clone git@github.com:agentic-research/venturi.git  # vulnerability intelligence (optional)
```

## Build rosary

```bash
cd ~/remotes/art/rosary
task install  # builds release, codesigns, installs to ~/.local/bin, sets up HTTP MCP service
```

This also installs a launchd service (`com.rosary.serve`) that runs the HTTP MCP server on port 8383. It auto-restarts when the binary changes (i.e., after each `task install`).

Verify: `rsry status` should print bead counts (or zeros if no repos are registered yet).

## Register your repos

```bash
cd ~/path/to/your/project
rsry enable .
```

This registers the repo in `~/.rsry/config.toml`, initializes the `.beads/` Dolt database, and installs git hooks. You can also edit the config directly:

```toml
[[repo]]
name = "my-project"
path = "~/path/to/your/project"
lang = "rust"  # or "go", "python", etc.
```

See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for all options.

## Start Claude Code with the rsry MCP

From any registered repo:

```bash
claude
```

If rsry is configured as an MCP server in your Claude Code settings, you now have 24+ tools for managing beads, dispatching agents, and creating workspaces — all available inside your Claude session.

To add rsry as an MCP server, add to your Claude Code MCP config (`~/.claude/.mcp.json` or project-level `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rsry": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8383/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

`task install` sets up the HTTP server automatically via launchd. All Claude Code sessions share one server — no stale binary problem after updates.

## The 0-to-1 workflow

### Phase 1: Ingest what you know

Dump your existing knowledge into the repo. Markdown files, docs, notes, analysis — anything you have. Claude is excellent at ingesting unstructured documents and extracting structure from them.

```
> Here are my findings so far [paste or reference files].
> Help me organize these into beads.
```

Each discrete finding, task, or question becomes a bead. Beads are atomic — one thing per bead, with a clear "done" condition.

### Phase 2: Define constraints, not tasks

Rather than writing detailed task descriptions, define measurable constraints that beads should satisfy. Think of it as **constraint-driven development**:

- "Every network endpoint must be documented with its data flow"
- "Files must stay under 200 lines"
- "No hardcoded credentials"
- "Every public function has a test"

Constraints that can be checked by code (linting, grep patterns, test suites) become verification tiers. Constraints that require judgment (architecture quality, naming clarity) become agent review criteria.

The [Golden Rules](../agents/rules/GOLDEN_RULES.md) are rosary's built-in constraints. You can add project-specific ones.

### Phase 3: Let Claude iterate with `/loop`

This is where the system starts compounding. Use `/loop` to have Claude periodically review and refine:

```
/loop 5m review all beads and docs, identify gaps, contradictions, or new threads to pull
```

Start with simple, low-risk tasks:

- Organizing findings into beads
- Cross-referencing docs
- Identifying missing test coverage
- Flagging constraint violations

Then scale up:

- Dispatching agents to fix beads
- Running the reconciliation loop
- Multi-repo coordination

### Phase 4: Dispatch

Once you have beads and confidence in the constraints, let rosary dispatch agents:

```bash
rsry run --once  # single reconciliation pass: scan → triage → dispatch → verify
```

Or from within Claude Code, use the `rsry_dispatch` MCP tool.

Rosary dispatches agents into isolated workspaces (jj workspaces or git worktrees). Each agent works a single bead, in isolation, against the verification pipeline. If the work passes all tiers (compile, test, lint, diff sanity), it's done. If not, it retries with backoff or deadletters for human attention.

The default is 3 concurrent dispatches. Start with 1 (`max_concurrent = 1` in config) until you trust the loop.

## Key concepts

| Concept          | What it means                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bead**         | Atomic work item. One clear task, one clear "done" condition. Lives in a repo's `.beads/` database.                                                                             |
| **Constraint**   | A measurable property that code must satisfy. Codifiable constraints become verification tiers. Judgment constraints become agent review criteria.                              |
| **Reconciler**   | The control loop: scan repos for beads → triage by priority and dependencies → dispatch agents → verify results. Kubernetes-controller style.                                   |
| **Workspace**    | Isolated VCS environment where an agent works. Created per-dispatch, destroyed after verification. Prevents agents from stepping on each other.                                 |
| **Pipeline**     | Sequence of agent perspectives a bead passes through. A bug gets `dev → staging`. A feature gets `dev → staging → prod`. Each phase is a different agent with a different lens. |
| **Verification** | Five-tier check after agent work: commit exists → compiles → tests pass → lint clean → diff sanity (≤10 files, ≤500 lines). First failure short-circuits.                       |

## Mache: structural code intelligence

Mache gives you (and Claude) structural understanding of codebases. Instead of grepping through thousands of files, you get:

```bash
# Start the mache service (if not already running via brew services)
brew services start mache
```

Then from Claude Code, the mache MCP tools are available:

- `get_overview` — structural map of a codebase
- `get_communities` — discover clusters of related code
- `find_definition` / `find_callers` / `find_callees` — symbol navigation
- `search` — structural pattern search

This is especially valuable when working with unfamiliar or decompiled codebases where you need to understand structure before you can make targeted changes.

## Two orchestrators

Rosary has two orchestration paths. You only need one to start.

**Rust reconciler** (`rsry run --once` / `rsry run`): The core loop. Scan → triage → dispatch → verify → push branch → create PR. Agents work in isolated worktrees, verification runs compile/test/lint, and the terminal step rebases onto latest main and creates a PR via GitHub App. Single-phase by default (dev-agent only).

**Elixir conductor** (`conductor/`): Full agent lifecycle management via OTP supervision trees. Adds multi-phase pipelines (dev → staging → prod), structured handoffs between agents, and crash recovery. Uses the rsry MCP over HTTP to read/write beads.

**Start with the Rust reconciler.** It gives you the full bead → workspace → verify → PR workflow. The conductor adds multi-phase pipeline advancement and supervision — useful once you're running agents overnight.

## What to know about jj + git

Rosary uses [jj](https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/) (Jujutsu) for workspace isolation when available, with git worktrees as fallback. If you're using jj with colocated git repos:

- `jj git import` / `jj git export` keeps the two in sync
- `git stash` behaves unexpectedly in colocated mode — prefer jj's native workflow
- Agent workspaces are isolated from your working copy regardless of which VCS backend is used

You don't need to use jj yourself. Rosary handles workspace creation and cleanup. But if you see jj-related state, that's why.

## Two modes, not a ladder

Rosary has two operating modes. They're parallel, not sequential — pick the one that fits the work.

### Collaborative: human + Claude + `/loop`

You're in a Claude Code session. Beads track your work. MCP tools give you and Claude shared state over the same repos, the same beads, the same code. `/loop` lets Claude iterate on your behalf — reviewing, refining, cross-referencing — while you set direction.

```
/loop 5m review all beads, identify gaps, flag constraint violations
```

This is the mode for exploratory work, analysis, research, onboarding to a new codebase — anything where human judgment drives and Claude grinds.

### Autonomous: `rsry run`

No human in the loop. Rosary scans repos for open beads, triages by priority and dependencies, dispatches agents into isolated workspaces, verifies results (compile → test → lint → diff sanity), and creates PRs. You review in the morning.

```bash
rsry run --once   # single pass
rsry run          # continuous reconciliation
```

This is the mode for well-defined work with clear constraints. The verification pipeline is the safety net — agents can only ship code that passes all tiers. Beads that fail too many times are deadlettered for human attention. The system stops rather than making things worse.

### Starting out

Begin with either mode depending on your work:

- **New to a codebase?** Collaborative. Ingest docs, explore with mache, capture findings as beads.
- **Have a backlog of well-scoped beads?** Autonomous. Let `rsry run --once` chew through them.

Both modes use the same beads, same constraints, same verification. The difference is who's driving.

## Troubleshooting

**`rsry status` shows nothing**: Your repos aren't registered or don't have `.beads/` directories. Check `~/.rsry/config.toml` and run `beads init` in each repo.

**Dolt connection errors**: Each `.beads/` directory runs its own Dolt SQL server. Check `dolt sql-server` is available in your PATH and that the port file (`.beads/dolt-server.port`) isn't stale.

**Agent dispatch fails immediately**: Check that `claude` CLI is in your PATH (the conductor uses `claude -p` for dispatch). The Rust reconciler uses the configured `[dispatch] provider`.

**Workspace cleanup**: Abandoned worktrees live in `~/.rsry/worktrees/`. Safe to delete if no agents are running.
