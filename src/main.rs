    //! Git hook management for bead sync (post-push / post-merge).
    //!
    //! Templates are embedded into the binary at compile time via `include_str!`
    //! so installation works in any environment — release images, packaged
    //! binaries, contributor checkouts — without depending on the source tree
    //! being adjacent to the executable.
    //!
    //! Installation is merge-aware: rather than clobbering existing hooks, the
    //! rsry block is spliced between the literal marker lines defined as
    //! [`MARKER_START`] and [`MARKER_END`] below. User content outside those
    //! markers is preserved across re-installs and the operation is
    //! idempotent. `MARKER_END` is intentionally short so the closing line is
    //! easy to grep for; `MARKER_START` carries the do-not-edit hint so
    //! anyone opening the hook file sees the convention without a separate
    //! README round-trip.
    //!
    //! The hooks directory is resolved via `git rev-parse --git-path hooks`
    //! so worktrees, submodules (`.git` is a file pointer to the real
    //! gitdir, not a directory), and `core.hooksPath` overrides all route to
    //! the right place.
