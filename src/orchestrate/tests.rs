//! Invariant tests for FeatureOrchestrator state machine.
//!
//! These tests express "Must Fix" findings from the 2026-04-07 architecture
//! review (Mark Esler). Each test is expected to FAIL until the underlying
//! bug is resolved. Do not delete these tests — fix the bugs instead.
//!
//! ## Must Fix findings
//!
//! ### Finding 1: Phase deadlock when synthesis=false
//!
//! After `on_worker_completed(passed=true)` with `synthesis=false`, the
//! orchestrator sets state to `AwaitingWorker` for the next phase. On the
//! following `tick()`, `AwaitingWorker` with no handle returns `Idle`.
//! The reconciler never learns it must spawn the next agent — the pipeline
//! is permanently stuck.
//!
//! Fix: `on_worker_completed` must produce a state that causes the next
//! `tick()` to emit `NeedsSpawn`, not `Idle`.
//!
//! ### Finding 2: Synthesizing bypass emits Idle instead of NeedsSpawn
//!
//! When `synthesis=true` but the synthesis step is not yet wired, the
//! `Synthesizing` match arm in `tick()` transitions to `AwaitingWorker` and
//! calls `self.tick()` recursively. That recursive call returns `Idle`
//! (no handle), so the outer `tick()` also returns `Idle`. The reconciler
//! never spawns the next agent.
//!
//! Fix: the `Synthesizing` bypass must emit `NeedsSpawn` directly (not via
//! a recursive `tick()` call on a state that can't produce `NeedsSpawn`).
//!
//! ### Finding 3: Session decision off-by-one in on_worker_completed
//!
//! `session_decision()` reads `self.current_phase` to derive the "current"
//! agent. But `on_worker_completed` increments `self.current_phase` to the
//! *next* phase **before** calling `session_decision`. The result: every
//! non-retry, non-verification advancement sees `current_agent == next_agent`
//! and matches the "same-agent retry → Continue" arm — even when the two
//! agents are different and a fresh session is warranted.
//!
//! Fix: capture the previous agent name before incrementing `current_phase`,
//! then pass it into the session decision logic.
