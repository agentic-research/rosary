//! Feature Orchestrator — per-bead lifecycle coordinator.
//!
//! Sits between the grand orchestrator (reconciler) and worker agents.
//! Each `FeatureOrchestrator` owns one bead's full lifecycle:
//!
//! 1. **Research fan-out** — spawn parallel read-only workers
//! 2. **Synthesis** — read worker output, build contextualized prompts
//! 3. **Implementation** — dispatch dev-agent with synthesized context
//! 4. **Verification** — staging-agent review, prod-agent safety check
//! 5. **Course correction** — mid-flight messaging, session continuation
//!
//! Inspired by Claude Code's coordinator mode and agent teams architecture.
//! Key principle: "never delegate understanding" — the orchestrator reads
//! worker output and synthesizes before dispatching the next phase.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! Grand Orchestrator (reconciler)
//!   ├─ FeatureOrchestrator A (bead X)
//!   │    ├─ research workers (parallel, ReadOnly)
//!   │    ├─ synthesis step (reads output, builds prompt)
//!   │    ├─ dev-agent (Implement)
//!   │    ├─ staging-agent (ReadOnly, adversarial)
//!   │    └─ mailbox (mid-flight communication)
//!   ├─ FeatureOrchestrator B (bead Y)
//!   │    └─ ...
//!   └─ ...
//! ```
//!
//! Enabled via `[orchestration] mode = "hierarchical"` in config.
//! Default `mode = "flat"` preserves existing reconciler behavior.
