//! Plan-mode approval gate.
//!
//! Before a worker starts implementing, it can propose a plan that the
//! orchestrator validates. This prevents the "agent rewrites half the
//! codebase" failure mode.
//!
//! Modeled after Claude Code's `planModeRequired` flag where teammates
//! must present a plan and get leader approval before writing code.
//!
//! ## Flow
//!
//! 1. Worker sends a `Plan` message to the mailbox
//! 2. Orchestrator validates: scope, risk, file overlap with other beads
//! 3. Orchestrator responds with `PlanApproval` (approved/revised/rejected)
//! 4. Worker proceeds with approved plan or revises
